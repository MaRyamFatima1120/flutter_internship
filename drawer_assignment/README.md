A Flutter project showcasing custom drawer designs.

Getting Started
This project demonstrates various custom drawer implementations in Flutter, created as part of my internship experience.

Features:
Custom Drawer Icons: Clean and tailored icons for a professional look.

Transparent Drawer Design: Modern, sleek drawers with transparent backgrounds.

Stack Widget Usage: Adds depth to the drawer by layering images.

Gradient Backgrounds: Creates a vibrant, dynamic appearance.

Design Replications: Replicas of popular drawer designs, including ChatGPT and Gmail.

Foodpanda-Inspired Design: Utilizes RoundedRectangleBorder for a distinctive rectangular drawer.

Documentation:

For more details on how each custom drawer is implemented, check out the code in the lib/ directory. The files are commented to explain the design choices and functionality.
