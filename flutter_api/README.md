Flutter API Project: Fetching and Designing with API Data
Getting Started
Welcome to the Flutter API Project! This repository is a starting point for integrating and designing with data fetched from APIs in a Flutter application. This project was created to explore API functionalities and implement dynamic designs based on the data received.

Features
API Integration: Demonstrates how to fetch and display data from an API.
Dynamic UI Design: Designs that adapt based on the fetched data.
Error Handling: Basic error handling for API requests.
JSON Data: Utilizes JSON for data interchange and visualization.
What I Learned This Week
While working on this project, I gained valuable insights into APIs and their integration:

Server and Client: A server provides data, resources, and services, which are requested by a client.
API (Application Programming Interface): A protocol for communication between client and server.
RESTful API: Popular architecture that separates the front end and back end, following a client/server model.
HTTP Methods: Includes GET, POST, PUT, UPDATE, DELETE for various data operations.
Status Codes: Numerical codes like 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 indicating the outcome of API requests.
Postman: A tool used for building, testing, and managing APIs.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): A lightweight format used for data exchange between systems.
JSONPlaceholder: A free API providing fake data for testing purposes.
Documentation
For detailed implementation and design choices, check out the code in the lib/ directory. Each file is commented to explain the design and functionality related to API integration.

Feedback & Suggestions
As I continue to learn and develop my skills in Flutter and API integration, I welcome any feedback or suggestions. Feel free to reach out or leave comments on the repository!
